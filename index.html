    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Several kids were walking down an unlit path... </p>
    <p> then a crazy person jumped out at them<p>
    <p>He waved a large stick around screaming jibberish..</p>
    <p> but in reality it was a spell to make it rain cash on the young kids, he was a wizard and his stick was a wand<p>
    <p>but he was no Harry Potter...more like a loser in tinfoil with a broken wand...</p>
